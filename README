The following files and folders contain the WEAP21 water resources model of the Verde River basin of Mexico, developed by UNOPS in 2017. 
E4 is the fourth scenario, which contains the following key attributes: 105m dam height, 8.6 m³/s water allocation for Guadalajara, León and Los altos, and future water demand and climate change as determinants for water availability.
E5 is the fifth scenario, which contains the following key attributes: 105m dam height, 7.4 m³/s water allocation for Guadalajara, León and Los altos, and fixed current water demand aas determinant for water availability.
E6 is the sixth the fourth scenario, which contains the following key attributes: 105m dam height, 7.4 m³/s water allocation for Guadalajara, León and Los altos, and future water demand and climate change as determinants for water availability.
These files need to be run by WEAP21 software to display the results and replicate the findings of the article "Understanding intractable water conflicts: The entanglement of politics and science in the decision-making on the Zapotillo dam project, Mexico.
